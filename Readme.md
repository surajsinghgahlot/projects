### Infra Diagram:

### Description:
1. It's a simple project where we helped the client to host their python app on AWS. <br/>
2. The current dev infra was on EC2 and their performing everything manually, like deploying new code installing new plugings etc.  <br/>
3. They are now ready to move to prod for which they want a reliable solutions, along with they want automate the whole process with CI/CD so that apps will deploy on server with a git push. <br/>

### Used Apps:
1. Amazon EC2 ElasticBeanstalk to deploy apps. <br/>
2. Amazon CodePipeline for CD. <br/>
3. Amazon ECR to save dockerimage. <br/>
4. Github to manage codebase. <br/>

### Apps Into:
1. **AWS EC2 ElasticBeanstalk**: <br/>
                    a. It is a service for deploying & scaling web applications. <br/>
                    b. It automatically handles the deploymentâ€”from capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto scaling to application health monitoring. <br/>

2. **Amazon CodePipeline**: <br/>
                     a. It isa  fully managed CD service that helps to automate the release pipelines for fast & reliable application & infrastructure updates with new codebase. <br/>
                     b. It can intregrate with any version control system like github, codecommit etc. <br/>
                     c. It composite of two steps i.e codebuild and codedeploy and together it is called codepipeline. <br/>

3. **AWS ECR**: <br/>
            a. It is a fully managed container registry where you can save deploy application images and artifacts. <br/>

4. **Github**: <br/>
                    a. It is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their codes. <br/>
                    b. It also help developer to manage the different versions(history) of code. <br/>

### Solution:
1. We helped them to containerize their application and the image is saved in ECR. <br/>
2. We used the same container to run the apps on the beanstalk. <br/>
3. The reason to choose beanstalk instead of fargate as it is more cheeper then fargate & client's developer was more friendly to it. <br/>
4. We created 2 branch in the repo one for dev and one for prod and connected with codepipeline through a oath read token. <br/>
5. The token gives access to codepipeline to pull the code, and along with dockerfile we also create a buildspec.yml & appspec.yml file. <br/>
6. Buildspec.yml & appspec.yml is a template file which gives instruction to codebuild & codedeply about the steps to perform on them. <br/>
7. Whenever developer push the code in github the codebuild build a docker image with the help of dockerfile and push it to ECR and then after  codedeploy deploy the same dockerimage in beanstalk. <br/>
